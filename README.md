# Vue.js Overview

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). It is designed to be incrementally adaptable and is easy to integrate with other projects.

## Key Features of Vue.js

1. **Reactive Data Binding**: Vue.js uses a reactive system to track changes in data and update the DOM accordingly.
2. **Component-Based Architecture**: Applications are built using reusable components.
3. **Directives**: Special tokens in the HTML that tell the library to do something with a DOM element (e.g., `v-if`, `v-for`, `v-bind`).
4. **Computed Properties & Watchers**: Helps manage complex data dependencies efficiently.
5. **Vue Router**: Allows the creation of single-page applications with dynamic routing.
6. **Vuex**: State management library for managing shared state across components.
7. **Lightweight & Fast**: Vue.js is designed to be performant and small in size.
